# 🌱 Inclusive Rural Credit Access

## 📌 Overview
Financial exclusion in rural areas is a pressing issue due to a lack of formal credit histories, economic vulnerability, and digital divides. Traditional lending systems fail to serve rural communities, forcing over 400 million individuals to rely on informal lenders with exploitative interest rates. This project presents an innovative, scalable solution leveraging alternative data and a mobile-first platform to enhance credit access. 📊📱
